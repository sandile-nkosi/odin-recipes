    <h3>What is iDombolo?</h3>
    <p>Dombolo, (also known as umbhako, ujeqe, dipapata in Setswana and rostile in Xhosa), is a traditional South African steamed bread. 
        It is a popular staple food in many homes within South Africa. The bread is prepared in a container in a pot of boiling water. 
        Dombolo can be made as whole bread or in dumpling-size balls. Serve Dombolo with a succulent stew or potjie.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Lukewarm water</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and lukewarm water together and allow to sit for 8 - 10 minutes or until foamy.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Add the flour and salt and mix until well combined. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 7 - 8 minutes or until smooth. 
            Place into an oiled metal bowl and allow to rise for 1 hour.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Once doubled in size, place the metal bowl into a simmering pot of water filled a quarter of the way up. 
            Place the lid on and steam for 1 hour or until a skewer comes out clean.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Make sure to keep topping up the water to ensure the water does not dry out.</li>
        <li>Remove the bowl from the simmering water and allow to cool slightly before removing the bread from the bowl. 
            Slice and serve warm with butter and a hearty stew, soup, or curry.</li>
